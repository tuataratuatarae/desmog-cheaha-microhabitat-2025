# Introduction

This markdown file contains analyses for my Honors Thesis on the
Talladega seal salamander (*Desmognathus cheaha*) which I have conducted
after consultation with my Thesis committee on November 27th, 2023.

At the microhabitat scale, I am interested in what factors predict
microhabitat selection by seal salamanders, particularly whether they
are actively selecting different cover objects.

-   For this dataset, I will be evaluating using binomial
    presence/absence models because while there were a few rocks that
    had multiple seal salamanders under them, that number was very low.
-   I will be filtering my data to only be for streams that have seals
    in them, because I have reason to suspect that there are water
    quality parameters influencing the presence/absence of seal
    salamanders (notably, temperature variation)
-   I will also be filtering my data to only include observations that
    were underneath rocks or wood. Two observations of seal salamanders
    were in burrows, which differ fundamentally in terms of
    microhabitat. In addition, we are dropping observations from
    leafpacks and individuals in the open because there were none of
    these observations with seal salamanders.
-   I will be running logistic regressions where:
    -   1 = seal salamander
    -   0 = no seal salamander BUT may contain other salamanders or
        crayfish

## Microhabitat data transformation

I need to make a few changes to the dataset to perform these analyses.
Below, I am going to:\
\* create a `rocky` substrate composite by adding the percent cover of
gravel and rock. \* create a binary response variable of points that
have seals or are completely vacant (not going to end up using this but
leaving it in the dataset in case it's useful). \* Creating a binary
response variable to compare places with seal salamanders to places with
other salamanders. \* Creating a binary response variable that compares
places that had any salamander to ones that were vacant

In addition, I am creating a subset of the data (`pWS`) which filters
the microhabitat dataset so that my analyses are only include points
from streams where we know that seal salamanders occur. This is because
we believe there are likely some water quality parameters affecting the
ability of other streams to support seal salamanders (see plotwise
models), and that there are likely suitable cover items in these streams
that don't have seals because the habitat isn't suitable for other
reasons.\
I am also filtering to only include observations where the cover type
was rock or wood, because there are some observations of seals in
burrows and I feel that the substrate data isn't comparable.

```{r}

pointsWide = pointsWide %>% 

  #creating a composite of rocky substrate
  mutate(rocky = per_grav + per_rock) %>%

  #creating a response variable for seal vs. fully vacant points
  mutate(sealVac = NA) %>%
  mutate(sealVac = ifelse(Occupied == 0, 0, sealVac)) %>%
  mutate(sealVac = ifelse(DCHE != 0, 1, sealVac)) %>%

  #creating a response variable to compare seals vs. other salamanders
  mutate(sealSal = NA) %>%
  mutate(sealSal = ifelse(salCount > 0, 0, sealSal)) %>%
  mutate(sealSal = ifelse(DCHE != 0, 1, sealSal)) %>%
  
  #creating a response variable for the presence of dusky salamanders
  mutate(duskPres = ifelse(DPER >0, 1, 0)) %>%
  
  #creating a response variable for the presence of 2-lined salamanders
  mutate(cirrPres = ifelse(ECIR > 0, 1, 0 )) %>%
  
  #creating a respnse variable to compare sal vs. non-sal points
  mutate(salVac = ifelse(salCount > 0 & crayCount == 0, 1, 0)) %>%
  
  mutate(nonsealSalCount = SAL + ECIR + DPER +PSRUB + D + EGUT, 
         nonsealOccCount = occupantCount-DCHE) %>%
  mutate(roommate = ifelse(nonsealOccCount >=1, "roommate", "no roommate")) %>%
  mutate(sealStream = ifelse(StrmID %in% c(sealStreams), 1, 0))

```



### Dealing with stream distance

*Sorting things by terrestrial/margin/stream* We are going to create a
categorical variable that sorts salamanders into a
terrestrial/margin/stream variable based on where they were found
in/around the stream. Here, we are going to create some rules that say:

-   Any point with a water depth of 1cm or less AND anything wthin 50cm
    of water is on the margin

-   Anything with a distance to water greater than 50cm is considered
    terrestrial

-   Anything with a deeper water depth is considered in the stream

50cm is considered the cutoff for terrestrial vs. marginal habitat
because when we do our band-level quadrats for marginal habitat we try
to center them on the edge of the stream with 50cm in the stream and
50cm out.

In addition, we are going to create a distDepth variable that combines
the stream distance and water depth variables by subtracting depth from
distance to water so that depth is a negative value.

```{r}
pointsWide = pointsWide %>%
  mutate(hab = ifelse(distWater > 50, "terrestrial", NA)) %>%
  mutate(hab = ifelse(cmDepth > 1, "stream", hab)) %>%
  mutate(hab = ifelse(is.na(hab) == T, "margin", hab)) %>%
  mutate(hab = as.factor(hab)) %>%
  mutate(distDepth = distWater - cmDepth)
# I am going to create a color palette to make this easier to interpret
habCols = c("stream" = "#9BC4BC", "margin" = "#4B5043", "terrestrial" = "#598218")

```




## Filtering to seal streams


```{r}

#filtering pointsWide to only include points from streams where seal salamanders are present
pWS = pointsWide %>%
  filter(StrmID %in% sealStreams) %>% 
         #filtering to only include observations that were under rock or wood
  filter(CoverType %in% c("R", "W")) 

# pointsWide %>%
#   filter(StrmID %in% sealStreams) %>% 
#   group_by(CoverType) %>%
#   summarize(count = n())


# pWS %>% group_by(sealPres) %>% summarize(count = n())


```




## Fitting a null model

This is how I figured out how to get the marginal/conditional r2: https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/169 
```{r}
mic_0 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_0)

resid_mic_0 = simulateResiduals(mic_0)
plot(resid_mic_0)

tab_model(mic_0)

confint(mic_0)
summary(mic_0)

exp(-2.1535)

performance::r2(mic_0)

AICc(mic_0)

```


# Microhabitat use by Seal Salamanders

## How does particle/pore space and the accumulation of sediment under cover objects affect presence/absence of seal salamanders?

From being in the field, it seems like jumbles of rock tend to make poor
habitat, so I am wondering whether/how that is reflected in the data. We're including an
interaction parameter for habitat type since there's a thought that
gravelly terrestrial substrates will be less suitable, though the
interaction doesn't seem to be significant.

sealPres \~ (%rock + %gravel) \* hab + (1\|StrmID), data = pWS

```{r}
pWS %>% ggplot(aes(x = rocky, y = sealPres)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(col = hab), height = .1) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = habCols) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial")) + 
  theme_bw()
```


The interaction with habitat seems to be very close to 1, so I am also
going to fit a version of the model without the interaction term.

```{r}
mic_1.1 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ rocky + hab + (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_1.1)

resid_mic_1.1 = simulateResiduals(mic_1.1)
plot(resid_mic_1.1)

tab_model(mic_1.1)

confint(mic_1.1)



AICc(mic_1.1)

exp( -18.672576852)
```



## How does the abundance of leaf litter affect cover object selection for seal salamanders?

I'm interested in whether salamanders are selecting rocks based on the
presence of leaf litter surrounding them. There were a number of rocks
that we found which served as physical infrastructure around which leaf
packs were formed, and presumably the presence of leaf litter allows for
places where salamanders are able to forage and find cover with a ton of
new surface area to chill out in.

sealPres \~ (%litter) + (1\|StrmID)

```{r}
pWS %>% ggplot(aes(x = per_litter, y = sealPres)) + 
  geom_jitter( height = .1) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial")) + 
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
mic_2.1 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ per_litter + (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_2.1)

AICc(mic_2.1)


resid_mic_2.1 = simulateResiduals(mic_2.1)
plot(resid_mic_2.1)

tab_model(mic_2.1)

confint(mic_2.1)

#obtaining the conditional and marginal r2
performance::r2(mic_2.1)

```

## How does the distribution of cover objects of various sizes in and around the stream affect the presence/absence of salamanders?

sealVac \~ coverObjArea \* hab + (1\|StrmID)

hab = stream, margin, terrestrial

For the model comparing seals points to vacant points in the stream, we
see that there is a strong relationship between occupancy and cover
object dimensions, but that there is no significant relationship for
each of the habitat type parameters.


```{r}
pWS %>% ggplot(aes(x = covArea, y = sealVac)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(col = hab), height = .1) + 
  xlab("Cover Object Area (cm^2)") + 
  ylab("Presence of Seal Salamanders") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = habCols) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial")) + 
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}

mic_3.1 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ covArea + hab + (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_3.1)

AICc(mic_3.1)


resid_mic_3.1 = simulateResiduals(mic_3.1)
plot(resid_mic_3.1)


confint(mic_3.1)

tab_model(mic_3.1)

```


## How does the presence of salamanders or crayfish affect the cover selection of seal salamanders?

Here, we test whether the presence of other salamanders affects the
presence of seal salamanders under cover items. Since larger cover items
are hypothetically able to support additional individuals, I am going to
include cover area as an interaction effect

Another thing that I'm thinking about is because larger cover objects are probably able to provide suitable habitat for multiple individual salamanders, how this factors into the suitability of larger rocks. 

```{r}
pWS %>% ggplot(aes(x = covArea, y = sealPres)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(col = as.factor(nonsealSalCount)), height = .1) + 
  #scale_color_manual(values = habCols) + 
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "binomial")) + 
  theme_bw()
```

`roommate` is a categorical variable in which `roommate[roomate]` designates the presence of an additional salamander species or crayfish and `roommate[no roommate]` designates the absence of an additional salamander species or crayfish

```{r}

mic_4.2 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ roommate * covArea + (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_4.2)


AICc(mic_4.2)

resid_mic_4.2 = simulateResiduals(mic_4.2)
plot(resid_mic_4.2)

tab_model(mic_4.2)

performance::r2(mic_4.2)

confint(mic_4.2)

fixef(mic_4.2)

shapiro.test(residuals(mic_4.2))

```

```


### Additive model of roommate + cover area as predictors of seal presence

We can see that in this model, the presence of a roommate is significant. However, since the interaction model performs better than this additive one, we select that model


```{r}

mic_4.3 = glmmTMB(sealPres ~ roommate + covArea + (1|StrmID), data = pWS, family = "binomial")
summary(mic_4.3)

AICc(mic_4.3)


resid_mic_4.3 = simulateResiduals(mic_4.3)

fixef(mic_4.3)

exp(c( -2.422635, -2.233670, 0.001897))


```
